ipl 16 stats from cricinfo

Hi all, I have used the XML package here to pull stats from cricinfo. Here are the steps to run a playoff model for the IPL

1. Various stats are computed at a team level - 2016 ipl stats R script

The purpose behind it is to see which factors lead to team success. 

We will put these team level stats into a model to check significant factors.

2. Training set is created - playoff16 R script

3. Test set is read in alongwith model creation- playoff R script
